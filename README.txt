The different content is all seperated into folders.
The main site stuff is all in /Website
The other folders are mainly to prove I made all the 3D models and assets from scratch.
You can just ignore like all of it if need be.
I also attached a video to display the parallax effect because on some computers it displays incorrectly.

Also you can use this to download the entire repositry:
https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FharL06%2FVintageGamesWebsite

or this because sometimes the other one doesn't work;
