The different content is all seperated into folders.
The main site stuff is all in /Website
The other folders are mainly to prove I made all the 3D models and assets from scratch.


I also attached a video to display the parallax effect because on some computers it displays incorrectly.

This was developed as my fifth-year Computer Science project in secondary school. This project allowed me to dive into the world of web development, combining HTML and CSS to create an immersive website dedicated to selling retro video games. 

Parallax Web Design:
The homepage and about page of Retro Game Haven feature parallax effects. They showcase custom designed 3D models of arcade machines and video game assets, adding a dynamic and visually captivating touch to the website.

3D Modeling Expertise:
All 3D assets used in the project, including arcade machines, video game assets, and spinning game cartridges, were designed from scratch using Blender. This not only demonstrates my proficiency in 3D modeling but also highlights my ability to seamlessly integrate 3D elements into a web environment.

Interactive Shopping Experience:
The shop page takes user engagement to the next level. Each game cartridge is presented in 3D and can be interacted with, allowing users to spin and examine the entire cartridge, providing an immersive and enjoyable shopping experience.
